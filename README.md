# Joney Bot

## About This Project

This project is my first dive into the world of AI, created as a fun way for me to learn and explore.

The idea was to build a simple, interactive AI chatbot for Discord. There are no complex commands to rememberâ€”just mention the bot's user (`@Bot Name`) with your question or prompt, and it will do its best to provide a helpful, interesting, or just plain fun response.

## How It Works

The bot follows a structured, multi-step process to decide when to search the web and how to synthesize information into a helpful answer. The core logic is visualized below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Main Request Thread
        A[User Mentions Bot] --> B[Fetch User Profile for Current Turn];
        B --> C{Intent Analysis};
        C --> |Search Not Needed| D[Generate Conversational Response];
        C --> |Search Needed| E[Plan & Generate Search Queries];
        E --> F[Execute Search via SearXNG];
        F --> G[Synthesize Answer from Search Results];
        G --> H[Format & Send Discord Message];
        D --> H;
    end

    subgraph Background Task - Memory Evolution
        I[Save Current Chat to DB] --> J{Profile Exists?};
        J --> |No| K[Fetch Recent Chats - Last 10];
        K --> L[Generate New User Profile];
        J --> |Yes| M[Fetch Old Profile & Most Recent Chat];
        M --> N[Update Existing Profile];
        L --> O[Save Profile to DB];
        N --> O;
        O --> P[End];
    end

    H --> I;
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you will need the following services available:

- **PostgreSQL w/ PGVector:** Used for persistent data storage, for now this is simply coversation history
- **SearXNG:** A running instance is required to act as the search engine tool for the bot.
- **Ollama:** Required to serve the local Large Language Model (LLM) that powers the bot's intelligence.

## Installation

You can run this bot either by building it directly from the source code with Python or by using the provided Docker Compose file for a containerized setup.

### Option 1: Build from Source

**1. Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonahgcarpenter/joney-bot.git && cd joney-bot
```

**2. Create your .env**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**3. Navigate to the App Directory**

```bash
cd app
```

**4. Create & Activate VENV**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**5. Install Dependancies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**6. Run the Server**

```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

**1. Create your .env**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**2. Run the Server**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Todo

- error handling for empty prompt
- new command to simply return context for the user
- move embedding model to ollama for a lighter container
- ignore @everyone, he should only answer when directly mentioned
- Get better output using trained models instead of system prompts
- Queue system for multiple request
