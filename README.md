# Joney Bot

## About This Project

This project is my first dive into the world of AI, created as a fun way for me to learn and explore.

The idea was to build a simple, interactive AI chatbot for Discord. There are no complex commands to rememberâ€”just mention the bot's user (`@Bot Name`) with your question or prompt, and it will do its best to provide a helpful, interesting, or just plain fun response.


## How It Works

The bot follows a structured, multi-step process to decide when to search the web and how to synthesize information into a helpful answer. The core logic is visualized below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Mentions Bot] --> B{Intent Analysis};
    B --> |Search Not Needed| C[Generate Conversational Response];
    B --> |Search Needed| D[Plan & Generate Search Queries];
    D --> E[Execute Search via SearXNG];
    E --> F[Synthesize Answer from Search Results];
    F --> G[Format & Send Discord Message];
    C --> G;
    G --> H[End];
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you will need the following services available:

* **PostgreSQL w/ PGVector:** Used for persistent data storage, for now this is simply coversation history
* **SearXNG:** A running instance is required to act as the search engine tool for the bot.
* **Ollama:** Required to serve the local Large Language Model (LLM) that powers the bot's intelligence.

## Installation

You can run this bot either by building it directly from the source code with Python or by using the provided Docker Compose file for a containerized setup.

### Option 1: Build from Source

**1. Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonahgcarpenter/joney-bot.git && cd joney-bot
```

**2. Create your .env**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**3. Navigate to the App Directory**
```bash
cd app
```

**4. Create & Activate VENV**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**5. Install Dependancies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**6. Run the Server**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose
**1. Create your docker-compose.yml file**
```bash
services:
  joney-bot:
    image: jonahgcarpenter/joney-bot:latest
    environment:
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=${DISCORD_TOKEN}
      - OLLAMA_HOST_URL=${OLLAMA_HOST_URL}
      - DB_HOST=${DB_HOST}
      - DB_PORT=${DB_PORT}
      - DB_NAME=${DB_NAME}
      - DB_USER=${DB_USER}
      - DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - DB_SCHEMA=${DB_SCHEMA}
```

**2. Run the Server**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
